My Family

My Family was inspired by my fianc√© Lien Tran.
She is the organizer in our family and whenever I ask
anything that relate to important documents, she would go through 
her folders to get it.  I want to make something that make it easier for her and this app came to mind.

Getting Started
- Clone this repo down
- npm install
- create a database 'prime_app', then create those 5 tables like in the database.sql
- npm run server, open another terminal and npm run client to start the app
